# Hyperscan

Hyperscan is a high-performance multiple regex matching library. It follows the
regular expression syntax of the commonly-used libpcre library, but is a
standalone library with its own C API.

Hyperscan uses hybrid automata techniques to allow simultaneous matching of
large numbers (up to tens of thousands) of regular expressions and for the
matching of regular expressions across streams of data.

Hyperscan is typically used in a DPI library stack.

# Documentation

Information on building the Hyperscan library and using its API is available in
the [Developer Reference Guide](http://intel.github.io/hyperscan/dev-reference/).

# Versioning

The `master` branch on Github/kunpengcompute will always contain the most recent 
release of Intel Hyperscan. 

The `aarch64` branch on Github/kunpengcompute will always contain the most recent 
release that supports the use of aarch64 architecture. The aarch64 branch was developed
based on Intel hyperscan 5.2.1. Each version released to `aarch64` branch goes through
QA and testing before it is released; if you're a user of aarch64, rather than a developer,
this is the version you should be using.

# Transplant

Add x86 and aarch64 platform judgment branches to the code of aarch64 branch.
According to the judgment results, choose to perform different operations, 
including compilation options, detecting specific header files, simd instruction
judgment, and so on.

# Optimization

Through the use of NEON instructions, inline assembly, data alignment, instruction 
alignment, memory data prefetching, static branch prediction, code structure 
optimization, etc., to achieve performance improvements on the Kunpeng platform.
